            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                At Globolingo, our mission is to connect people from different cultures and backgrounds through the power of language. 
                Our format is simple, fun, and free for everyone.
            </p>
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
                Here's how it works: attend a Globolingo event at one of our partner venues. When you arrive, you'll receive stickers 
                representing the languages you speak. Place them on your shirt or jacket, with your native language at the top. Then, you're free to do what you want: 
                mingle, practice, and learn with other attendees in a relaxed and friendly environment.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
            At Globolingo, people always come first. We are committed to ensuring a welcoming environment free from spam, intrusive data collection, or financial obligations. If you'd like to support what we do, feel free to grab a drink at the bar whenever it suits you.
            Our events are designed to let participants enjoy a relaxed, social setting without unnecessary interruptions. No gimmicks, announcements, games, or any activities that might disrupt your experience. No wristbands, no sign ups, no flyers, no raffles. Just genuine connections in a comfortable space. Your personal space and autonomy are always respected.
            </p>
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that language learning should be accessible to everyone, and Globolingo events create opportunities to meet 
                new friends, improve your skills, and share cultural experiences.
